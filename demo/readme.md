# Disclaimer
This library is POC only and has no established/good API. Note that editing data isn't available now.

# What is it?

This is a demo for small and easy-to-use D library that allows to quickly add GUI into graphic application like Ant Tweak Bar.

# Difference to Ant Tweak Bar

This lirary heavily uses D meta programming functionality that allows to add complex and non-trivial data structures like user defined structs, for example Nullable or TaggedAlgeraic. Also the library supports arrays of data (ranges of them can be added too)
